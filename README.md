# College Industrial Visit Travel Form

Welcome to the College Industrial Visit Travel Form project repository! This project demonstrates the creation of a web-based travel form designed specifically for college students participating in an industrial visit. The form is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and PHP technologies, and it's meant to collect essential information from students who wish to participate in the upcoming industrial visit organized by the college.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The form offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that guides students through the process of submitting their details efficiently.

- **Responsive Design:** The form is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring that it remains accessible and functional on a variety of devices.

- **Data Validation:** Input fields are equipped with client-side and server-side data validation to ensure accurate and reliable data submission.

- **Server-Side Processing:** PHP scripting handles the data processing on the server side. Submitted data is securely stored and managed in a MySQL database.

- **Dynamic Date and Time Stamping:** The form captures the submission date and time automatically, providing valuable metadata about when the form was filled out.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the form, including input fields, labels, and buttons, is created using HTML5.

- **CSS:** CSS3 is utilized for styling the form, making it visually appealing and responsive.

- **PHP:** Server-side scripting is implemented using PHP to process the form data and interact with the database.

- **MySQL:** The XAMPP server includes a MySQL database where form submissions are stored securely.
